            <h2> How many Should We Put You Down For?</h2>

            <aside style="float:right; width:20%"><p><b>“Never give someone a chance to say no when selling your product.”</b></p></aside>

            <p style="float:left; width:80%">
                The first big rule in sales is that if the person leaves empty-handed,
                they're likely not going to come back. That's why you have to be somewhat
                aggressive when you're working with a customer,
                but you have to make sure you don't overdo it and scare them away.
            </p></br></br></br>

            <p>
                One way you can keep a conversation going is to avoid asking questions that have yes or no answers. For example,
                if you're selling a service plan, don't ever ask “Are you interested in our 3 or 5 year service plan?”
                Instead, ask “Are you interested in the 3 year service plan or the 5 year plan, which is a better value?”
                At first glance, they appear to be asking the same thing, and while a customer can still opt out,
                it's harder for them to opt out of the second question because they have to say more than just “no.”
